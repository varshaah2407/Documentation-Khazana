# About Big Data

This technology (Big Data Analytics) has a variety, high-volume, and velocity information that requires cost-effective, innovative types of information processing for increased insight and also for support in decision making to any organization.

This definition clearly gives the answer to the question “What is Big Data?” Big Data or Big Data Analytics refers to a large number of data sets that must be examined and processed in order to collect information that can be useful by businesses and organizations for a variety of purposes, including decision-making, forecasting the future and more.

However, there is some more information about Big Data Analytics that is going to make it, even more, simpler to answer the question of what is Big Data Analytics:

It refers to a huge amount of data that remains growing with respect to time.
Its volume is so much that it cannot be processed or analyzed using normal data processing techniques.
It contains data storage, data sharing, data mining, data visualization, and data analysis.
The term is an all-comprehensive one containing data frameworks, data, along tools and techniques used to process and analyze the data.

# Roles and Responsibilities

# Demand for Big Data Engineer

Recently, Peter Sondergaard of Gartner Research highlighted the importance of Big Data Analytics in the modern digital world when he stated that:

“In the 21st century, Information, Research, and data are the oil, and analytics is the engine that runs on it.”

The amount of data we’re generating every minute is continuously increasing day by day. While Data Science gurus swear by the significance of data, what will be the use of data if there aren’t enough professionals with Big Data Analytics skills? Who is able to analyze these massive quantities of data and convert them into a valuable business resource?

As organizations around the globe know the true potential of data, the demand for skilled. Big Data Analytics professionals are increasing with time. To process this data, c is very important.

# Technologies used in Big Data Analytics

## Hadoop Ecosystem

Hadoop Framework was built to store and process data with a simple programming concept in a distributed data processing system. Data from a variety of high-speed and low-cost equipment can be saved and evaluated. Organizations have adopted Hadoop as Big Data Analytics for their data warehouse requirement for the past few years. It seems like this trend will continue to grow in the next coming year also. Organizations that have not adopted Hadoop so far are mostly going to see its advantages and applications in the future.

## Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence(AI) is a broad bandwidth of computer technology that is associated with the development of intelligent machines which can carry out multiple tasks typically requiring human intelligence. AI is growing so fast from Apple’s Siri to self-driving cars like Tesla. Being an interdisciplinary branch of Computer Science, it takes into account multiple approaches such as increased Deep Learning and Machine Learning to develop a remarkable shift in most tech industries. AI is transforming the existing Big Data Technologies.

## NoSQL Database

NoSQL contains multiple varieties of Big Data Technologies in the DBMS, which are built to develop modern applications. It shows a non-SQL or non-relational database giving way for data recovery and acquisition. They are used in Big Data Analytics and the Web in real-time. It stores unstructured data, provides faster performance and flexibility, and can handle a variety of data types, such as Redis, Cassandra, and MongoDB. It gives easier horizontal scaling, design integrity, and control over opportunities in a wide range of devices. By default, it uses data structures that are separate from those used by databases, allowing NoSQL calculations to run faster. Google, Twitter, Facebook, and multiple similar companies store user data terabytes daily.

## R Programming

R is one of the open-source programming languages used in the field of Big Data analytics. This free software which can be used by any user is mostly used in computing, statistical visualization, unified development environments such as Visual Studio and Eclipse which are assistance communication. According to experts’ opinion, it has been one of the world’s leading languages of all time. The language is also mostly used by data miners and statisticians to build statistical software which is mainly focused upon big data analytics.

## Data Lakes

Data Lakes is also known as a consolidated repository for the storage of multiple types of data formats at all levels in terms of structural and unstructured data.

Data can be saved at the time of Data collection without being converted into structured data. It enables performing multiple types of Data analysis from dashboards and Data visualization to Big Data conversion in real-time for good business interference

# Salary of big data engineer

From the Glassdoor report, the average Big Data Engineers salary in India is around Rs.8,56,643 LPA. Still, the Big Data Engineer’s salary completely depends on several factors, including company size, education qualifications, job position, geographical location, and work experience. Big organizations like IBM, Amazon, Accenture, Deloitte, Airbnb, Spotify, Netflix, and Capgemini, usually offer a good package. Also, if you have more experience in Big Data Analytics, the higher will be your market value in the industries.

Due to the shortage of Big Data engineers as compared with demand, companies are ready to offer a good package to freshers and candidates having some years of experience in Big Data Engineering as well. A Big Data Engineer with less than one year of experience can earn an average yearly income of Rs.4,00,676 LPA, according to PayScale data.

# Skills required to be a Data Engineer

Some of the most important skills to become a successful Big Data Developer are:

- Knowledge of Hadoop-based technologies or Hadoop Frameworks.
- Knowledge of Real-time processing frameworks like Apache Spark.
- SQL-based technologies.
- Knowledge of NoSQL-based technologies such as Cassandra, MongoDB, HBase.
- Knowledge of any one programming language (Java/Python/R).
- Visualization tools such as Tableau, QlikSense, QlikView.
- Data Mining tools like KNIME, Rapidminer, etc.
- Knowledge of Machine learning algorithms.
- Knowledge of Statistical & quantitative analysis.
- Good knowledge of Unix or Linux or Solaris or MS-Windows.
- Must have creative thinking ability and problem-solving.
- Must have Business Knowledge.

# Future Scope of Big Data Analytics

Big Data is an ever-growing sector. It is gaining popularity with its potential application in many organizations. Thus, a career in the field is one of the perfect choices for one who is looking for a long and stable career with high rewards.

As data continues to grow and expand, cloud space providers like Microsoft Azure Google Cloud, AWS and are going to rule in storing big data. This will increase room for scalability and efficiency for companies. This also means there will be more and more candidate hired to manage these data, which translate to more job opportunities for “Big Data Engineers” to handle the database and huge amount of data of a company.,

Looking at stats it can be determined that organizations are adopting this new technology and in the future, Big Data is going to be one of the best technologies.

# Conclusion:

Because of Big Data, the industry is transforming to the next level. But, data is of no use unless there’s someone to analyze it and unravel the hidden patterns inside it. Businesses want insights from Big Data, and that is why they’re always looking for skilled professionals in this sector – candidates who can unlock the secrets that Big Data analytics holds.

Technologies in Big Data analytics like Spark and Hadoop are the buzzwords now. So, be sure to learn how to work with related tools like HBase, MapReduce, SparkSQL, GraphX, Spark RDD, Spark Streaming, SparkR, MLlib, Flume, Sqoop, Oozie, Kafka, Data frames, Hive, and many more.
