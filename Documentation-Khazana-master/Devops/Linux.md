Linux is one of popular version of UNIX operating System. It is open source as its source code is freely available. It is free to use. Linux was designed considering UNIX compatibility. Its functionality list is quite similar to that of UNIX.

## <ins>**Components of Linux System**</ins>
Linux Operating System has primarily three components

* **<ins>Kernel</ins>** - Kernel is the core part of Linux. It is responsible for all major activities of this operating system. It consists of various modules and it interacts directly with the underlying hardware. Kernel provides the required abstraction to hide low level hardware details to system or application programs.

* **<ins>System Library</ins>** - System libraries are special functions or programs using which application programs or system utilities accesses Kernel's features. These libraries implement most of the functionalities of the operating system and do not requires kernel module's code access rights.

* **<ins>System Utility</ins>** - System Utility programs are responsible to do specialized, individual level tasks.

The architecture of a Linux System consists of the following layers âˆ’

* **<ins>Hardware layer**</ins> - Hardware consists of all peripheral devices (RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc).

* **<ins>Kernel**</ins> - It is the core component of Operating System, interacts directly with hardware, provides low level services to upper layer components.

* **<ins>Shell**</ins> - An interface to kernel, hiding complexity of kernel's functions from users. The shell takes commands from the user and executes kernel's functions.

* **<ins>Utilities**</ins> - Utility programs that provide the user most of the functionalities of an operating systems.
