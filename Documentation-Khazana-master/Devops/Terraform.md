<br>

  HashiCorp Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool that allows DevOps engineers to programmatically provision the physical resources an application requires to run.

  <ins>***Infrastructure as code***</ins> is an IT practice that manages an application's underlying IT infrastructure through programming. This approach to resource allocation allows developers to logically manage, monitor and provision resources -- as opposed to requiring that an operations team manually configure each required resource.

Terraform users define and enforce infrastructure configurations by using a JSON-like configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). HCL's simple syntax makes it easy for DevOps teams to provision and re-provision infrastructure across multiple cloud and on-premises data centers.<br>

## What is Terraform used for?
  * <ins>External resource management</ins> - Terraform supports public and private cloud infrastructure, as well as network appliances and software as a service (SaaS) deployments.
* <ins>Multi-cloud deployment</ins> - the software tool's native ability to support multiple cloud services helps increase fault tolerance.
* <ins>Multi-tier applications</ins> - Terraform allows each resource collection to easily be scaled up or down as needed.
* <ins>Self-service clusters</ins> - the registries make it easy for users to find prepackaged configurations that can be used as is or modified to meet a particular need.
* <ins>Software defined networking (SDN)</ins> - Terraform's readability makes it easy for network engineers to codify the configuration for an SDN.
* <ins>Resource scheduler</ins> - Terraform modules can stop and start resources on AWS and allow Kubernetes to schedule Docker containers.
* <ins>Disposable environments</ins> - modules can be used to create an ad hoc, throwaway test environment for code before it's put into production.
