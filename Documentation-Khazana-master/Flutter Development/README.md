# Flutter
---
Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google.In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android) as well as website.

To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called **Dart**. Dart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications.

## Why you should learn Flutter?😎
- Simple to learn and use:
Flutter is a modern framework, and you can feel it! It’s way simpler to create mobile applications with it. If you have used Java, Swift, or React Native, you'll notice how Flutter is different.

- Quick compilation: maximum productivity:
Change your code and see the results in real-time. It’s called Hot-Reload. It only takes a short amount of time after you save to update the application itself.

- Good documentation💯:
It’s important for new technology to have good documentation. But it’s not always the case that it has it!

- A growing community🌝:
Flutter has a robust community, and it’s only the beginning!

## What to learn as a beginner to Flutter development💪🏻

Once you start developement with flutter you will find it very easy.
Now is a good time to start learning Flutter. There are many resources on the internet, and information overload can be overwhelming. That's why we have come up with the best resources that can help you learn Flutter in the right way. There is a lot of documentation available on the official flutter website, but you should refer to other resources for more depth and variety.

### Check List for beginner's
1. [Card-Application](https://github.com/mufida1018/Card_App) : As you construct this application, you gain experience with fundamental widgets like row, column, container, and so on.
2. [DICEE](https://github.com/mufida1018/DICEE): Know that you know some basic idea about flutter🤜🤛 lets dive into widget like gesturedetector
3. [Magic-Ball](https://github.com/mufida1018/Magic-Ball): Again a basic app to have hands-on widgets that you learned previously
4. [xylophone](https://github.com/mufida1018/xylophone): At the end of development you would know how to use Audio in flutter 🎵.

### Whoooo Ooohhhh🤘🥳, You have learned basics of Flutter Development

#### Let's Dive you from beginner to intermediate🚀
1. [BMI calculator](https://github.com/mufida1018/BMI-Calculator)
2. Chat-Application
3. [Quotes-Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzpDrZi6AsI&t=231s)
4. [Pokemon Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4pt1ACoR9c&t=44s)

There are many good courses designed by Udemy, loads of videos on Youtube and other online sources for learning Flutter. If you are already into mobile app development, a good course will help you learn quickly so that you can get on board. However, if your project has relaxed timelines, you should do more experiments, try to build your widgets by setting up your local environment and read a book or two to know about more complex designs. Books will help you fill the gaps between what you already know and what you need to learn.

## Good luck with the progress, continue to learn 💙🙌🏻
