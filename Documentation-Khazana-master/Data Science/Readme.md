# What is Data Science?

Data Science is the process of extracting useful information from unstructured data using ideas like statistical analysis, data analysis, machine learning techniques, data modeling, data preparation, etc. The daily production of ever-increasing amounts of digital data has led to massive developments in the data science field. Therefore, it got clear that Computer Science and statistical methods could be used to find trends in the data and draw valuable conclusions from it.

# What does a Data Scientist do?

Data scientists spend some of their time analyzing datasets and looking for insights that can help businesses improve key metrics. But that’s not the only thing that data scientists do.

Data scientists work with key stakeholders at businesses to find out what their major challenges are. This lays the foundation for the data science process. The challenges of a business become problem statements for data scientists.

They then proceed to build data models and write algorithms that can process data. All of this is done with the goal of finding solutions to the initial problem statement. Data scientists use various techniques to make this happen, including mathematical analysis, predictive modeling skills, natural language processing, regression analysis, deep learning, and analytical thinking.

Data science’s applications are virtually unlimited.

# How to Get Into Data Science [Step-by-Step Guide]

## Step 1: Identify What You Need To Learn

It's always essential to think about the abilities you already possess and the ones you'll need to develop because data scientists need various skills to fill various job roles within a business.

You'll probably need to sharpen your skills on specific topics. For instance, you might be a very skilled coder but have never engaged in data visualization. So, you have to learn new abilities in fields that are unfamiliar to you. Make sure you follow up a theory with practice by picking one section at a time.

## Step 2: Brush Up on Your Fundamentals

It is crucial to remember that for entry-level employment, companies are more interested in your understanding of the principles of Data Science.

So, be sure to gain as much knowledge in Data Science fundamentals as possible. You should be able to comprehend Math concepts like Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Statistics applied to solving real-world problems and how both Math and Computer Science can be used in data analytics. It would help if you also have an understanding of basic Computer Science concepts like Relational Databases, SQL, Programming, and Distributed Computing is also included.

## Step 3: Know Your Math

A profession in Data Science necessitates a strong foundation in Math, and you must be familiar with tackling issues related to Statistics, Probability, and Optimization. When starting with Data Science, focus on Statistics, particularly ideas like Variability and Correlations.

After establishing a solid statistical basis, you should start learning Linear Algebra and Calculus. You can begin applying these ideas to the field of Data Science once you have a fundamental grasp of them.

## Step 4: Programming for Data Science

Data Science programming does not concentrate on a particular user. Instead, solving business challenges and data analysis are the main priorities. Your programming will become much more math-intensive and reliant on data processing methods. Practice Data Analysis using sample datasets as much as possible in computer languages like Python and R.

## Step 5: Get Familiar With Data Visualization Tools

There are several reasons why data visualization is crucial. It's one way you can learn more about your personal data analytics procedure. Sometimes visualizations draw attention to data trends you might not have noticed otherwise.

You may communicate your thoughts in a clear, understandable way by using data visualization tools while giving presentations as a data scientist.

## Step 6: Join a Data Science Bootcamp

A Data Science boot camp can be a fantastic opportunity to learn from an expert in the field and take advantage of the benefits of a welcoming community.

## Step 7: Pursue an Internship and Build Your Projects

You can start submitting applications for internships. Data Science internships are available at some of the top organizations in the world, including Google. These give you a chance to learn more about the operations of Data Science teams and the issues they are addressing. Focusing on your projects is another way to use your abilities.

## Step 8: Build a Portfolio

Create a portfolio to display your skills once you've gained some experience. A Data Science portfolio should consist of a selection of your best-completed projects. They demonstrate to hiring managers the types of issues you've been able to resolve and the tools and programming languages you employ.

## tep 9: Network Extensively

In any field, networking is crucial, but it's even more essential if you're attempting to work in Data Science without a degree. Meeting with different industry stakeholders involved in Data Science should be done as frequently as possible. Connecting with professional data scientists can provide you with a lot of knowledge. Engage with an experienced data scientist at your organization or find them on LinkedIn.
