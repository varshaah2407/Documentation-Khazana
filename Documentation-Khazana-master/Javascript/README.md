# Java Script

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. 

The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers. Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published.

## Difference between Java Script and Java Programming

Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.

## What to learn as a beginner to Java Script?

* building blocks of Java Script 
    
    * code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.
    * object-oriented nature of JavaScript
    * key JavaScript features such as variables, strings, numbers, and arrays.

## how to move from beginner to intermediate Java Script?

* Understanding JavaScript frameworks

    * JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with proven tools for building scalable, interactive web applications.
    
    * Frameworks provide developers with the basic foundation necessary for building JavaScript applications. This saves developers the effort of starting from scratch by utilizing a functional base to get things rolling.

* Equality comparisons 
    
    * JavaScript provides three different value comparison operations: strict equality using ===, loose equality using ==, and the Object.is() method.
  
 ## how to move from intermediate to advanced Java Script?

* JavaScript typed arrays
    
    * JavaScript typed arrays provide a mechanism for accessing raw binary data.

    * JavaScript typed arrays are array-like objects that provide a mechanism for reading and writing raw binary data in memory buffers. Array objects grow and shrink dynamically and can have any JavaScript value. JavaScript engines perform optimizations so that these arrays are fast.

* Memory Management
    * Memory life cycle and garbage collection in JavaScript.
  
    * Some high-level languages, such as JavaScript, utilize a form of automatic memory management known as garbage collection (GC). The purpose of a garbage collector is to monitor memory allocation and determine when a block of allocated memory is no longer needed and reclaim it.
