# Nodejs developer roadmap in 2022

<hr>

Nodejs is a very popular runtime environment for chrome V8 javascript engine. The popularity of nodejs is increasing every day for scalable network applications.

Nodejs is javascript based and it enables javascript developers to write backend (server) applications.

Nodejs uses event loops that allow nodejs to perform non blocking I/O operations.

In this tutorial, we will look at the tools and languages needed to be known to be a successful nodejs developer.

## Javascript

Javascript is one of the key languages while learning nodejs, you should learn javascript as well. Javascript evolves every year and increases its power more than ever.

Nodejs is totally built on javascript. Learning javascript will increase your nodejs knowledge significantly.

## NPM

Npm is a package manager for the javascript libraries and frameworks.

While you are learning how to create nodejs projects and you will need to use the package manager (NPM) to install the required packages to your local device.

You can search for the packages in npm through their website.

Learning npm also will be done along with the projects you make with React as well.

## Git

In programming, git is one of the most important tools you need to learn to submit your code and work with another developerâ€™s code.

If you are started learning git, you can have a look most used 8 GitHub commands

Typescript helps me to identify possible issues when I write the code itself. That provides me actually much more time than searching the whole code flow for some bug in the code itself.

## +Bonus GraphQL

Graphql is a very powerful tool and it makes queries and requests much easier. After learning API structures with nodejs i suggest you to learn graphql afterwards.
